        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML uses the id attribute as a way to identify elements and select them</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage (metadata).</li>
          <li>Metadata is not seen by viewers</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML elements can include text, image, header, list elements and more</li>
          <li>We using heading elements in descending order to give our webpage structure</li>

          <li>To link a CSS file to an HTML: < link rel="stylesheet" href="pathway of css file" ></li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element (like margins in a word doc, if set to 0, text can run to the very end of the page).</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element (essentially, makes that element bigger).</li>
          <li>Class attributes - allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule</li>
          <li>Remember that we can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>
