        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML uses the id attribute as a way to identify elements and select them</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage (metadata).</li>
          <li>Metadata is not seen by viewers</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML elements can include text, image, header, list elements and more</li>
          <li>We using heading elements in descending order to give our webpage structure</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>* applies CSS styling to ALL elements on a page</li>
          <li>To link a CSS file to an HTML: < link rel="stylesheet" href="pathway of css file" ></li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element (like margins in a word doc, if set to 0, text can run to the very end of the page).</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element (essentially, makes that element bigger).</li>
          <li>Class attributes - allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule</li>
          <li>Remember that we can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>

          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. </li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

              <ol>
                <li>Once I have made changes to new branch, make sure I am in that branch in my local environment</li>
                <li>git add -A: sets up all changes to be committed</li>

                <li>git pull origin main: verifies that the local branch is in sync with the main branch in GitHub</li>
                <li>git push origin name-of-branch-being-merged: Once verified, we can push the changes from the local branch into the remote</li>
                <li>Go to remote branch. In the dropdown menu, go to the new branch. Select the "Compare and Pull Request" button. Give the pull request a decriptive title. Designate base branch as "main" and comparison branch as whatever the new branch is titled. Then click "Create Pull Request"</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>A variable can hold several types of data:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>String - a sequence of text inside of quotes</li>
              <li>Number - this is a number and doesn't need quotes around it</li>
              <li>Boolean - this is a true/false value</li>
              <li>Array - This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference. These values can be different data types. Arrays are enclosed inside square brackets</li>
              <li>Objects - This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li> 
            </ol>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. The computer reads JS from top to bottom. Using conditional statements such as "if" statements allows us to interrupt control flow</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. These can be "if" statements or "if...else" statements. Conditionals test whether or not the condition provided is truthy. If it is, then the condition is met and an action is executed</li>
          <li>For loops - use the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>Functions - a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. Usually look like a variable name followed by parentheses. Functions often take arguments (bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument).</li>
          <li>Events - Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. For example, a click event</li>
          <li>ChromeDevTools - allows you to test code more easily by viewing the console. Use "control + shift + i" to access</li>
