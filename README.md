# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to help keep me organized throughout the course of the bootcamp. It served as a platform to practice applying certain coding principles and habits. It solves the problem of me knowing basically nothing about program and coding best practices. I learned how to structure different types of page content and how use version control responsibly.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section of this webpage contains notes on what I learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript so I can quickly and easily refer to them.

Additionally, if you open the DevTools, you can see my JavaScript code running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
